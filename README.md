# Chat Bot WhatsApp
## Description
This project is a chat bot for WhatsApp, it is a bot that can be used to send messages, create stickers and archive chats. This project is made with the help of the [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) library, which is a library that allows us to automate the browser, in this case we use it to automate WhatsApp.

## Installation
To install the project you must have python 3.8 or higher installed, then you must install the dependencies with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the project you must run the main.py file with the command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Then you must scan the QR code that appears in the CMD and that's it, you can use the bot on any chat in WhatsApp.

## Commands
The commands of the bot need to be written with the prefix "/bot", for example:
```bash
/bot oi
```
The commands are:
- oi: The bot will respond with "Olá, tudo bem?".
- sair: The bot will respond with "Saindo!" and will stop running.
- sticker: The bot will create a sticker with the last image sent in the chat.
- arquivar: The bot will archive all chats.
- arquivar grupo: The bot will archive all groups chats.
- arquivar chats: The bot will archive all chats there are not groups.

and if you send a message with the prefix "/bot" and the bot does not recognize the command, it will respond with "Não entendi".
