## Description
This project is a chat bot for WhatsApp, it is a bot that can be used to send messages, create stickers, archive chats, transcribe audios, summarize chats and use the ChatGPT in the chats. This project is made with the help of the [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) library, which is a library that allows us to automate the browser, in this case we use it to automate WhatsApp.

## Installation
To install the project you must have python 3.8 or higher installed, then you must clone the project with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FelipeRibeiro16/Chat-Bot-Whatsapp.git
```

After that you must install the FFmpeg, you can download it [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), then you must add the FFmpeg to the PATH of your system if you use windows, you can see how to do it [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10).

Then you must install the dependencies with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And finnaly to use the ChatGPT you must provide a API key on a .env file in the root of the project, for caching responses and for dump the messages of summarization you must set 'True' or 'False' to not, the .env file must have the following content:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
CACHE_RESPONSES='True'
DUMP_MESSAGES='True'
```

You also can modify the personalization of the responses and summarizations of the ChatGPT in the files chat_response_role.json and message_summary_role.json in the folder /data/bot-config.
## Usage
To use the project you must run the main.py file with the command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Then you must scan the QR code that appears in the CMD, after that the bot will display the message "Define main chat...", which means that you have to define the main chat by sending a message to the chat you want to be the main chat with command setting in the method `listen_set_main_chat(command)`, beware that after set the main chat cannot be changed until the bot is restarted, and may be dangerous to set a main chat that others can send messages, so choose wisely. After that the bot will display the message "'Main chat defined!". Then the bot will be ready to use.
## Commands
The commands of the bot need to be written with the prefix "/bot"(this can be changed in the main.py file), for example:
```bash
/bot oi
```
The commands are:
- adicionar: The bot will list the chats there are unarchived and you must choose one of them to add to the list of chats that the bot will listen to. To choose a chat you must send the number of the chat, listed by the bot, after that the bot will respond with "Adicionado com sucesso!", in case of error the bot will respond with "Não foi possível adicionar!" (Only available in the main chat).
- sair: The bot will respond with "Saindo!" and will stop running (Only available in the main chat).
- figurinha: The bot will create a sticker with the last image sent in the chat.
- arquivar: The bot will archive all chats (Only available in the main chat).
- arquivar grupo: The bot will archive all groups chats (Only available in the main chat).
- arquivar chats: The bot will archive all chats there are not groups (Only available in the main chat).
- resumir: The bot will list the chats there are unarchived and you must choose one of them to
summarize the messages. To choose a chat you must send the number of the chat, listed by the bot, after that the bot will respond with "Extraindo mensagens..." and will start to extract the messages, after that the bot will respond with "Processando..." and will start to process the messages, after that the bot will respond with the summarize of the messages (Only available in the main chat).
- transcrever: The bot will transcribe the last audio sent in the chat.

And if you send a message with the prefix "/bot" without a command the bot will use the [ChatGPT] to respond to the message.
